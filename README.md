# ara2

This repository contains the ARA2 corpus used in the paper "From sentence to action: Splitting AMR graphs for recipes instructions" (Stein et al. 2023)

Similar to the ARA1 corpus, the ARA2 corpus consists of recipes for 10 different dishes from the [Microsoft Research Multimodal Aligned Recipe Corpus](https://github.com/microsoft/multimodal-aligned-recipe-corpus). For each dish, there are 11 recipes parsed into action graphs. In contrast to the ARA2 corpus, there are currently no action alignments available for the ARA2 corpus.
